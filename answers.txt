Q1: - What are the three uses of the curly brackets {} in Ruby?
1) to designate code blocks in place of do/end
2) to create a new hash object
3) string variable interpolation, used in context with double quotes and "#{variable}"

Q2: - What is a regular expression and what is a common use for them?
A regular expression is a string pattern matching language that is used to find, extract, and replace substrings of text from a larger string

Q3: - What is the difference between how a String, a symbol, a FixNum, and a Float are stored in Ruby?
A Ruby symbol is immutable and there is only one memory object for a given symbol name.
A Ruby string can be changed and every usage/instance of a string creates a distinct in-memory instantiation of the string.
FixNums are integers that are < 31/63 bits (depending on 32-bit or 64-bit architecture). They are immutable like symbols.  They simply exist and cannot be created explicitly.
Floats are double-precision 64-bit numbers that are inexact representations of numbers.  Each instantiation of a float gets a unique ObjectID in memory.

Q4: - Are these two statements equivalent? Why or Why Not?
    1. x, y = "hello", "hello"
    2. x = y = "hello"
No, they are not equivalent.  In #1 x and y will point to different object_id's in memory, in #2 x and y will point to the same object_id
